# Arkanoid Game

## Overview
Arkanoid is a classic brick-breaking game where players control a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks. In my version of Arkanoid, I incorporated different levels and challenging gameplay elements, utilizing the principles of object-oriented programming.

Written in Java, this version of Arkanoid features intuitive controls, multiple levels, and various bonuses that add complexity and fun to the gameplay. Dive into this nostalgic journey and break your way through layers of bricks!

The complete code is available in my repository. Feel free to check it out and enjoy playing!
