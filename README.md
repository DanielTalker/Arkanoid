Arkanoid is a classic brick-breaking game where players control a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks. In my version of Arkanoid, I incorporated different levels and challenging gameplay elements, utilizing the principles of object-oriented programming. The complete code is available in my repository. Feel free to check it out and enjoy playing!
